## Data Project - Round 1

Get the [IPL Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/manasgarg/ipl)

	Download both csv files from https://www.kaggle.com/manasgarg/ipl

	Code python functions that will transform the raw csv data into a data structure in a format suitable for plotting with matplotlib.

	Generate the following plots ...

	1. Plot the number of matches played per year of all the years in IPL.
	2. Plot a stacked bar chart of matches won of all teams over all the years of IPL.
	3. For the year 2016 plot the extra runs conceded per team.
	4. For the year 2015 plot the top economical bowlers.
	5. Discuss a "Story" you want to tell with the given data. As with part 1, prepare the data structure and plot with matplotlib.

### Projects:

NavTree Project in Jquery

	Repository name: navtree-(name) Example navtree-john

	Build a hierarchical, navigable tree structure using jQuery. The tree structure should be at least 3 levels deep.

	For example:

	Depth 0
	-- Depth 1
	-- Depth 2

	It should expand and minimize to reveal and hide nested nodes. Do not use an existing library to build the tree structure.

	Please use the IPL dataset that you had previously used for the Visualisation assignment. An example hierarchy could be

	Year > Team > Players

	When the last entity is selected, show a stat relevant to that identity on the page. This can either be a visualisation or a table.
